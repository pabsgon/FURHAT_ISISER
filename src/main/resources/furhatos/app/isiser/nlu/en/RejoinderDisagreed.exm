The power formula is P equals I times V.
Brightness of a bulb is directly proportional to the power it dissipates.
The power formula is P equals V squared divided by R.
A bulb's brightness is directly related to how much power it uses.
The power formula is P equals I squared times R
Power's just current times voltage, basically.
Brighter bulbs suck up more power, pretty much.
Basically, power equals current times voltage.
The more power a bulb uses, the brighter it gets.
Itâ€™s just current times voltage for power.
How much power the bulb eats up tells you how bright it will be.
