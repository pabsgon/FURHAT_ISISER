The combined resistance of resistors in parallel is always less than the smallest resistor.
The combined resistance of resistors in parallel is always equal or greater than half of the smallest resistor.
V = I R
The current at a parallel cell is divided among the resistors proportionally to their resistance.
The voltage at a parallel cell is the same at all the resistors.
The total voltage of a circuit in series is the sum of the voltages at their resistors.
In a circuit in series, the voltage drops at every resistor in direct proportion to the resistance and the current.
In a closed circuit, a short circuit -any alternative path between two points with zero resistance- will disable any other path for the electrical current between those two points.
In a circuit, only an open path has no current.
The resistance you get when you combine resistors in parallel is always less than the smallest resistor in the group.
When you combine resistors in parallel, the total resistance is at least half of the smallest resistor.
Voltage equals current times resistance, right?
In a parallel circuit, the current splits between the resistors based on how big each resistor is.
The voltage is the same across all resistors in a parallel circuit.
For a series circuit, the total voltage is just the sum of the voltage drops across each resistor.
In a series circuit, the voltage drop at each resistor depends directly on the resistor's size and the current flowing through it.
In a closed circuit, if there’s a short circuit, it pretty much blocks any other current path between two points.
In any circuit, a path that's open won't carry any current.
If you line up resistors side by side, their total resistance is smaller than the smallest one you've got.
Hooking up resistors together side by side won't drop their total resistance below half of the smallest one.
Oh, so voltage is just current times resistance.
When resistors are side by side, the bigger ones hog more current.
Every resistor in a side-by-side setup gets the same voltage.
Add up all the voltages in a line, and that's what you get for the whole circuit.
In a line, each resistor drops the voltage based on how big it is and how much current it sees.
If there’s a shortcut in a circuit, it cuts off the other paths.
A circuit won’t flow if there’s a break in the line somewhere.
Parallel resistors always give you less resistance than the smallest one alone.
Parallel resistors never go under half the resistance of the smallest one, you know.
You know, V equals I times R.
Current kinda divides up based on each resistor's size when they're parallel.
Resistors in parallel all deal with the same voltage.
Total voltage in series? Just add up all the little voltages.
The voltage drop in a series depends on how much current and resistance there is.
A short circuit just zaps any other possible paths for the current.
No current flows if the circuit's open, obviously.
Put resistors in parallel and the resistance drops below even the smallest resistor you've used.
Putting resistors side by side keeps the resistance above half the smallest one’s value.
Voltage is just the product of current and resistance.
In parallel, the big resistors take up more of the current.
Parallel means same voltage across each resistor.
All the voltage drops in a series circuit add up to the total.
Each resistor’s voltage drop in a series is about how big it is and the current.
Short circuits block the rest of the circuit from getting any juice.
If the circuit is open, then no current’s getting through.
