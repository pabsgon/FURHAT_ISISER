Give me a minute
Can you give me more time?
Let me think
GIve me a second
Give me a sec
I need a minute
I need more time
Wait a moment
Hold on please
Hold on
Give me a moment
I need a moment
Just a sec
Just a moment
Hang on a second
Let me have a moment
I need a second
Allow me a minute
I need to think this through
Can I take a moment?
One moment, please
Hold up
Wait up
Let me see
Just give me a moment
I need some time to think
A moment to think, please
Please wait a bit
Let me ponder that
Can I have a second?
Let me take a moment
A bit more time, please
Give me a tick
Hold that thought
Let me mull it over
Just a beat
Hold your horses
Let me gather my thoughts
Two shakes
Bear with me
Gimme a sec
Let me chew on that for a minute
Back in a flash
Hang tight
Just need a moment
Wait a sec
Let me take a quick second
Let me process that
Gimme just a moment
Need a sec to think
Just hang on a minute
Let me catch my breath
Not yet
Yet
I'm not ready
I am not ready
I didn't finished
I am not done
I am not ready yet
I didn't finished yet
I am not done yet
